# CS4371Project

Group 15 consists of Hunter Treadway, James Allen, Nathan Padgett, Chris Hanly, and Sam Nava.

Functionality of the Project:
Our project is the connection between an IoT device/ endpoint, a server (with a database as a component of the server), and an IoT application. The
purpose of our project is to encrypt the potential data flows between the 3 points of contact.

How to run the Project:   
Step 1: See the provided instructions.txt to set up the connection to the database.   
Step 2: Pip install numpy, request, mongoDB.   
Step 3: Once connected to the database, run the application.   
Step 4: Application with run and encrypt.  
Step 5: See change in door status.   

How to clone Project:   
Step 1: To begin the cloning process, click the green CODE button on the main repository page.   
Step 2: Copy the repository's URL (Can be done using SSH, HTTPS, or GitHub CLI).   
Step 3: Open Git Bash and change the current directory to the location where you would like the cloned repository.   
Step 4: Type [git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY]   
Step 5: Press enter to create a local clone.   
Step 6: Done   .
