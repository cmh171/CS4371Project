# Instructions on setting up and getting the web server running on your device

1. If it's not already installed, install NPM.
	a. This varies between windows and MacOS. 
		 It's pretty straightforward. Google and Chatgpt will help.

2. Accept your invitation to the mongodb atlas database (if you haven't done so already)

// No longer needed, ignore step 3
3. Edit server.js line 11 (the connection string)
	a. place 'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@application.dkdfsrp.mongodb.net/'
		as the connection string
	b. insert your username and password in the respective fields from the list of creds below.

4. Open terminal or powershell

5. In the shell, make sure you're in the directory where server.js and stateModel.js are (serverpack)

6. Then run these three commands in order
	a. npm init -y
	b. npm install express mongoose
	c. npm start

7. Read the console output. Try and make sure that the server was able to connect to MongoDB.
	a. If it was able to do it, it will say so.

8. You should now be able to make HTTP posts against the server. 
	a. For a tool to test posts against the server, install and use Postman.


CURRENTLY SUPPORTED HTTP REQUESTS:

1. Check if the server is alive and responding

3. Check the status of a given door

4. Update the status of a given door
HTTP POST:: http://localhost:3000/test/doors/update
